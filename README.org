* Tribal Interfaces
[[file:img/cavee.jpg]]

A collection of vcvrack modules created through the timeless principle - /as within, so without/.

"Here at tribal interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the communication you need with the
collective unconscious. That's right. We help connect you with the tribe inside - the archetypal
energies that dance with the sun to emerge art into being. A wurly /WeoOOoeo/ guy singing mamma mia?
An uptight HRmmm *Hrmmm* sage humming electric snakes? Whoever it may be, it has come into being
through yours and your ancestors concert with the rest of the song of the universe, and we are here
to help you /manifest/ it!  Tribal Interfaces - /because alignment matters./''

Our =Circle=  module allows you to create an emergence of the tribe members that visit the
temple of your body. All you have to do is create sonic representations of them, and use the
provided means to emerge them with simplicity and /flow/. So now the drum man repeating *order* order
*order* order can emerge with a luscious goddess of love as she dances from chord to chord just as a rose grows
around a trellis - without the computer spirit coming between them! That's right. How do we do
it? Ladies and gentleman, we have ingeniously intuitively ingeniated a novel mechanism of emerging
sound representations. We combine the real-time feeling of live-looping with the features of
timeline recording so that your precious aligned unfolding is *not* lost in the muck of 21st century
computer interfaces and does *not* get stuck in a loop. Yes, the =Circle= module gives you the means to
/conduct a music circle/ of your visitors, and it does it /oh soo good/. Map your =Circle= module, and creating multi-spirit
progressive music is now a matter of learning to use three buttons and a foot pedal. Afterall, why
stare at your monitor when you can stare at the cosmic ocean from which all experience emerges from?
Or better yet, why love mind knacks and poly-techno false idols when you can love the great mother?

** TODO Memory
Stage 1: A file player / crossfader that allows one to filter a file bank using tags in file name.
  e.g. 'fire' & 'air', 'parallel', 'electric', 'fizz', 'transients', 'energetic'
  
#+begin_quote
So you have a visitor. He sounds like 'KrkkrkkKKrrjjjj'. The Memory module provides you with your
first step to manifesting the sound - by recalling an associated sound!

Stage 2: Auto extract tags
- train an AI model by giving it some plugins & parameters to play with, then feed it files and have
  it spit out it's guesses for parameter settings such as 'distortion', 'space', 'pan', 'reverb',
  'density'...

** TODO Creation
An expander for memory  which creates new files by synaesthizing properties from existing files -
e.g. 'pitch of guitar melody' + 'texture of steam whistle'

relies on ai models extracted features

** TODO Synaesthesia
Audio-Visual synesthesia display.
Audio -> (Trained Qualitative Audio Features Extractor) -> Features /e.g. pan, fuzz, distortion, pitch.../ -> Visuals
