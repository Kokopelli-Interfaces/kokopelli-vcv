* Tribal Interfaces
[[file:img/cavee.jpg]]

A collection of vcvrack modules created through the timeless principle - /as within, so without/.

"Here at tribal interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the communication you need with the
collective unconscious. That's right. We help connect you with the tribe inside - more specifically,
the archetypal energies that dance with the sun to emerge art into being. A wurly /WeoOOoeo/ guy? An
uptight HRmmm *Hrmmm* teacher? A drum guy repeating *order* order *order* order? Whatever it may be, it's
emerged through your concert with the rest of the song of the universe, and we can help you /hear/ it!
You just create the sonic representation, and our interfaces allow you to facilitate an emergence of
the tribe members that visit the temple of your body - with grace and simplicity. Using our patent
pending design, you will find your music sessions at least 70% more aligned. That's right. How do we
do it? Ladies and gentleman, we have overhauled the very mechanism of creating compositions. Yes,
the =Gko= module gives /you/ the means to /facilitate a music circle/ for your visitors. Creating
beautiful music is now a matter of learning to use three buttons and a foot pedal. Afterall, why
stare at your monitor when you can stare at the cosmic ocean from which all experience emerges from?
Or, why love mind knacks and poly-techno false idols when you can love the great mother? Tribal
Interfaces - /'because the above really should be the below./''
