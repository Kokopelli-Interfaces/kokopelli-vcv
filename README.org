"Here at Kokopelli Interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the interfaces you need to manifest your unconscious. That's right. We help you bring the village inside, outside. Our interfaces our designed with the timeless principle - /'as within, so without'/ - so your may rest assured that your archetypal energies can emerge with our mediums to create art true to your unfolding. The spirit of Abba's Dancing Queen singing inside you? Your guardian angel of love? Your magician and his visions of the universe? Whoever it may be, they have come into being by virtue of yours and your ancestors concert with the rest of the song of the universe, and we are here to help you bring them into the world!"

- Kokopelli Interfaces - /because alignment matters./

#+begin_quote
Our =Circle= module allows you to conduct a music circle of the village members that visit the temple of your body. You just create the sonic representations of them and use our provided means to /emerge/ them - with simplicity and /flow/. So now the drum man repeating *order* order *order* order can emerge with a goddess of love to dance as trellis and rose - without the computer spirit coming between them! How do we do it? Ladies and gentleman, we have ingeniously intuitively ingeniated a novel mechanism of composition. We combine the real-time feeling of live-looping with the features of timeline recording so that your precious aligned unfolding is *not* lost in the muck of 21st century computer interfaces and does *not* get stuck in a loop. Map your =Circle= module, and creating multi-layered progressive music is now a matter of learning to use three buttons and a foot pedal. Afterall, why stare at your monitor when you can stare at the cosmic ocean from which all experience emerges from? Or better yet, why love mind knacks and poly-techno false idols when you can love the great mother?

** TODO [#B] Gko
Expander for circle
Records the Energy flow of Circle (e.g. group A... -> group B... -> new voice in group B...) on a timeline

** TODO [#C] Memory
#+begin_quote
The Memory module provides you with your first step to manifesting the sound - by recalling an
associated sound. How does recall work? Well, just like how your memory works.

Let's assume our memory is a network of association. One approaches the network with a key, and the most
associated experience is re-experienced. The =Memory= module works just the same, though unlike most
audio players, the retrieval key used is not just the name of the audio file. One can access the
audio of the =Memory= module with keys of more divine order - so one can recall files through abstract
qualifiers such as 'distorted', 'complex', 'chaotic', 'fire', or combinations of them!

There are thousands of examples of audio in our memory, and we create higher level order out of the
examples by generalizing patterns and spectrums out of examples. What results is a higher plane of
sound keys... /Fizz, Parallelism, Chaos, Complexity, Character, Mood, Confidence, Velocity, Energy,
Speed, Timbre, Pitch.../

Stage 1: A file player / crossfader that allows one to filter a file bank using tags in file name.
  e.g. 'fire' & 'air', 'parallel', 'electric', 'fizz', 'transients', 'energetic'
  
Stage 2: Auto tag file collection using Qualitative Audio Features

Stage 3: Cloud access

** TODO [#C] Creation
An expander for the Memory module which creates new sounds by blending properties from existing
files - e.g. 'pitch of guitar melody' + 'texture of steam whistle'

** TODO [#B] Synaesthesia
An audio-Visual synesthesia display.
Audio -> (Trained Qualitative Audio Features Extractor) -> Features /e.g. pan, fuzz, distortion, pitch.../ -> Visuals
