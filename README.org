A collection of vcvrack modules created through the timeless principle - /as within, so without/.

"Here at tribal interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the communication you need with the
collective unconscious. That's right. We help connect you with the tribe inside - the archetypal
energies that dance with the sun to emerge art into being. A wurly /WeoOOoeo/ guy? An uptight HRmmm
*Hrmmm* teacher? Whoever it may be, it has come into being through yours and your ancestors concert
with the rest of the song of the universe, and we can help you /manifest/ it! How so? Our interfaces
allow you to facilitate an emergence of the tribe members that visit the temple of your body, /with
grace and simplicity/. All you have to do is create the sonic representations, and our interface
allows you to emerge them in beautiful ways! So now the drum guy repeating *order* order *order* order
can emerge with a luscious goddess of love as she dances from chord to chord as a rose wrapping
up and around the trellis of the drums. That's right. How do we do it? Ladies and gentleman, we have
ingeniously intuitively ingeniated a novel mechanism of emerging sound representations. We combine
the real-time feeling of live-looping with the features of timeline recording so that your precious
aligned unfolding isn't lost in the muck of 21st century computer interfaces. Yes, the =Gko= module
gives /you/ the means to /facilitate a music circle/ for your visitors, and it does it /oh soo good/.
Creating multi-spirit progressive music is now a matter of learning to use three buttons and a foot
pedal. Afterall, why stare at your monitor when you can stare at the cosmic ocean from which all
experience emerges from? Or, why love mind knacks and poly-techno false idols when you can love the
great mother? Tribal Interfaces - /because alignment matters./'' #+end_quote
