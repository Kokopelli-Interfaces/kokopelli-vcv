* Tribal Interfaces
[[file:img/cavee.jpg]]

A collection of vcvrack modules created through the timeless principle - /as within, so without/.

"Here at tribal interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the communication you need with the
collective unconscious. That's right. We help connect you with the tribe inside - more specifically,
the archetypal energies that dance with the sun to emerge art into being. A wurly /WeoOOoeo/ guy? An
uptight HRmmm *Hrmmm* teacher? A drum guy repeating *order* order *order* order? Whatever it may be, it's
emerged through your concert with the rest of the song of the universe, and we can help you /hear/ it!
You just create the sonic representation, and our interfaces allow you to facilitate an emergence of
the tribe members that visit the temple of your body - with grace and simplicity. That's right. How
do we do it? Ladies and gentleman, we have ingeniously reworked the very mechanism of creating
compositions. We combine the real-time feeling of live-looping with the features of timeline
recording so that your precious aligned unfolding isn't lost in the muck 21st century computer
interfaces. Yes, the =Gko= module gives /you/ the means to /facilitate a music circle/ for your visitors,
and it does it /oh soo good/. Creating beautiful music is now a matter of learning to use three
buttons and a foot pedal. Afterall, why stare at your monitor when you can stare at the cosmic ocean
from which all experience emerges from? Or, why love mind knacks and poly-techno false idols when
you can love the great mother? Tribal Interfaces - /'because alignment matters.'/''
