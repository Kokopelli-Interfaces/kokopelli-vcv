[[file:img/cavee.jpg]]

A collection of vcvrack modules created through the timeless principle - /as within, so without/.

"Here at Kokopelli Interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the communication you need with your
unconscious. That's right. We help connect you with the village inside - the archetypal energies that
emerge with mediums to manifest art. The spirit of Abba's Dancing Queen? A HRmmm *Hrmmm* guy humming
electric snakes? Your angel of love watching over you? Your magician and his visions of the
universe? Whoever it may be, they have come into being by virtue of yours and your ancestors concert
with the rest of the song of the universe, and we are here to help you express them!"

- Kokopelli Interfaces - /because alignment matters./

#+begin_quote
Our =Circle= module allows you to create an emergence of the village members that visit the temple of
your body. All you have to do is create sonic representations of them, and use the provided means to
emerge them with simplicity and /flow/. So now the drum man repeating *order* order *order* order can
emerge with a goddess of love to dance as trellis and rose - without the computer
spirit coming between them! That's right. How do we do it? Ladies and gentleman, we have ingeniously
intuitively ingeniated a novel mechanism of emerging sound representations. We combine the real-time
feeling of live-looping with the features of timeline recording so that your precious aligned
unfolding is *not* lost in the muck of 21st century computer interfaces and does *not* get stuck in a
loop. Yes, the =Circle= module gives you the means to /conduct a music circle/ of your visitors, and it
does it /oh soo good/. Map your =Circle= module, and creating multi-spirit progressive music is now a
matter of learning to use three buttons and a foot pedal. Afterall, why stare at your monitor when
you can stare at the cosmic ocean from which all experience emerges from? Or better yet, why love
mind knacks and poly-techno false idols when you can love the great mother?

** TODO [#B] Gko
Expander for circle
Records the Energy flow of Circle (e.g. group A... -> group B... -> new voice in group B...) on a timeline

** TODO [#C] Memory
#+begin_quote
The Memory module provides you with your first step to manifesting the sound - by recalling an
associated sound. How does recall work? Well, just like how your memory works.

Our memory is a network of association. One approaches the network with a key, and the most
associated experience is re-experienced. The =Memory= module works just the same though unlike most
file players, the retrieval key used is not just the name of the audio file. One can access the
audio of the =Memory= module with keys of more divine order - so one can recall files through abstract
qualifiers such as 'distorted', 'complex', 'chaotic', 'fire', or combinations of them!

There are thousands of examples of audio in our memory, and nature creates higher level order out of
the examples via experiential-aggregation-emergence. On this higher plane are sound qualifiers and spectrums
which come to being by seeing the patterns across many examples ... /Fizz, Parallelism, Chaos,
Complexity, Character, Mood, Confidence, Velocity, Energy, Speed, Timbre, Pitch... All examples of
order our divinity-emerging brains creates.

*Hey Dude!* /What?/ *Let's explore sound!* /Uhm sure I guess, but there's a lot of it./. *That's why the
skytrain exists maaaaan.* /What?/ *The skytrain!* /Okay.../ *Dude. The skytrain gets you where you need to
go.* /What?/ *Why walk around in a neighbourhood of random sounds, when you can take the elemental
express to fire town, or water town, or even air town!?* /What?/ *Why walk around wh-* Please leave my
children alone.

#+begin_example
Stage 1: A file player / crossfader that allows one to filter a file bank using tags in file name.
  e.g. 'fire' & 'air', 'parallel', 'electric', 'fizz', 'transients', 'energetic'
Stage 2: Auto tag file collection using Qualitative Audio Features
Stage 3: Cloud access
#+end_example

** TODO [#C] Creation
An expander for the Memory module which creates new sounds by blending properties from existing
files - e.g. 'pitch of guitar melody' + 'texture of steam whistle'

** TODO [#B] Synaesthesia
An audio-Visual synesthesia display.
Audio -> (Trained Qualitative Audio Features Extractor) -> Features /e.g. pan, fuzz, distortion, pitch.../ -> Visuals
