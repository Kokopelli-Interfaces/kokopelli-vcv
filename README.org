"Here at Kokopelli Interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the interfaces you
need to express your creativity. That's right. We help you bring the village
inside, outside. The spirit of Abba's Dancing Queen? A low resonance in your
stomach? Accents and intonations? Visions of the universe? Whatever it may be,
it has come into being through yours and your ancestors concert with the rest of
the universe, and we are here to help you manifest it! Designed with the
timeless principle - /'as within, so without'/ - our interfaces go the extra mile
to meet you in /your/ experience of music, so that home stays nearby."

Kokopelli Interfaces - /because alignment matters./

** [#A] Circle

[[./img/README_2021_09_11__22:28:00.png]]

#+begin_quote
Our =Circle= module allows you to conduct a music circle of village members that visit your body. You
just create the sonic representations of them, and use our provided means to /emerge/ them with flow.
The =Circle= module combines the real-time feeling of live-looping with the features of timeline
recording. The result is that your aligned unfolding is *not* lost in the muck of 21st century
computer interfaces and does *not* get stuck in a loop. Map your =Circle= module, and creating
multi-layered, progressive music is now a matter of learning to use three buttons and a foot pedal -
because why stare at your monitor when you can stare at the cosmic ocean from which all experience
emerges from?

** [#B] Gko
#+begin_quote
Gko is a word for the advancer of existence - whatever that may be. When placed by a =Circle= module, it
can record the energy movement of the music circle onto a timeline.

** [#C] Memory
#+begin_quote
The Memory module provides you with your first step to manifesting a sound in your head - by recalling an
associated sound.

The =Memory= module works like most audio players, though the 'retrieval key' is not limited to the
name of the audio file. One can access the audio of the =Memory= module with keys of more /divine/
order - so one can recall files through abstract qualifiers such as 'distorted', 'complex',
'chaotic', 'firey', or combinations of them!

There are thousands of examples of audio in our memory, and higher level order emerges out of
examples by generalizing patterns and spectrums. What results is a higher plane of retrieval keys...
/Fizz, Parallelism, Chaos, Complexity, Character, Mood, Confidence, Velocity, Energy, Speed, Timbre,
Pitch.../ 

The Memory module interacts with you on this plane.

Stage 1: A file player & crossfader that allows one to filter a file bank using tags in file name,
  using fuzzy search bar. e.g. 'fire' & 'air', 'parallel', 'electric', 'fizz', 'transients', 'energetic'
  
Stage 2: Auto tag files using =Qualitative Audio Features= extractor

Stage 3: Access to cloud of auto-tagged audio examples

** [#C] Create
An expander for the Memory module which creates new sounds by blending properties from existing
files - e.g. 'pitch of guitar melody' + 'texture of steam whistle'.

** [#B] Synaesthesia
An audio-Visual synesthesia display.
Audio -> =Qualitative Audio Features=  extractor -> Features /e.g. pan, fuzz, distortion, pitch.../ -> Visuals
