These modules provide an interface for adding to, editing, and playing back an arbitary capture
of signals in time. The signals could be the audio output of some modules, it could be the output
from your MIDI keyboard, parameter automation, really, anything.

The recording interface is the 'Gko' module. You can give it input/output ports by placing either the 
~SIG~, ~4SIG~, or ~PLAY~ module next to it.
