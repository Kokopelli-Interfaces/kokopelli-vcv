A collection of vcvrack modules created through the timeless principle - /as within, so without/.

"Here at tribal interfaces.. we work hard to deliver /you/ the communication you need with the
collective unconscious. That's right. We help connect you with the tribe inside - the archetypal
energies that dance with the sun to emerge art into being. A wurly /WeoOOoeo/ guy singing mamma mia?
An uptight HRmmm *Hrmmm* sage humming electric snakes? Whoever it may be, it has come into being
through yours and your ancestors concert with the rest of the song of the universe, and we can help
you /manifest/ it! Our interfaces allow you to create an emergence of the tribe members that visit the
temple of your body. All you have to do is create sonic representations of them, and use our
provided means to emerge them with simplicity and /flow/. So now the drum man repeating *order* order
*order* order can emerge with a luscious goddess of love as she dances from chord to chord as a rose
around a trellis of sound - without the computer user coming between them! That's right. How do we do
it? Ladies and gentleman, we have ingeniously intuitively ingeniated a novel mechanism of emerging
sound representations. We combine the real-time feeling of live-looping with the features of
timeline recording so that your precious aligned unfolding is *not* lost in the muck of 21st century
computer interfaces and is *not* stuck in a loop. Yes, the =Gko= module gives you the means to
/facilitate a music circle/ for your visitors, and it does it /oh soo good/. Creating multi-spirit
progressive music is now a matter of learning to use three buttons and a foot pedal. Afterall, why
stare at your monitor when you can stare at the cosmic ocean from which all experience emerges from?
Or, why love mind knacks and poly-techno false idols when you can love the great mother? Tribal
Interfaces - /because alignment matters./''
