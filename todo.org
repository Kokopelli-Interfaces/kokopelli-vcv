CLOSED: [2020-11-02 Mon 22:18]
No clk, just twist to engage, and loop upon exitting.

* DONE Frame - Buffer structure
CLOSED: [2020-11-02 Mon 22:18]
Create a structure that holds buffers that frame reads back.

* TODO Frame - smooth out transitions
so that there are no clicks and pops
put under layer::read()
layer has start offset and end offset, just smooth that part out in the reading

* TODO Frame - fix polyphony
* TODO Frame - delete buffers that are erased
- don't delete if timeline is recording in futrue
* TODO Frame - rework to have rotary knobs so no limit on scenes and layers
- have rotary knob instead of buttons for layer switch
- have selection button to add layer to seelction
- have copy cutton to copy selected scenes
- have mix knob control selection:all ratio
- remove undo in favor of

lcm of all layer lengths 
* TODO Frame - 
* TODO Frame COPY / Delete button 
copy / delete selected layers into a spot
press once to copy selected into holding place
hold to clear buffer, or to delete selected if no buffer 

* TODO Frame-MUX module
same as frame, but has additional ~FRAME~ parameter to select active frame
** TODO frame knob
change which frame is active, is a frame multiplexer with this.
* TODO Timeline -
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./img/todo_2020_11_04__20:41:37.png]]

- a sequencer for frame scenes as well as states
- make it an expander for either ~FRAME~ or ~FRAME-MUX~
- timline is sectioned into SCENES which are sectioned into divisions
  - events may occur at divisions, such as:
    - scene transitions,
    - new frame layers being introduced
    
** TODO progress knob
- when right, timeline is extended when scene end is reached by looping scene again
- when default, progresses normally
- when left, loops scene

** TODO select some or all layers via visual
selected layers are highlighted
** TODO scrub knob
move along timeline
** TODO ability to offset layer contents
** TODO visual
top half is layers of active frame
* TODO Frame-VIS 
layers of change visualizer expander for frame
can also use to select specific layers
and also create offsets for buffers
* TODO Timeline-VIS
timeline visualizer for timeline
can also use to click and drag events to different division points
* TODO Frame refractor
** TODO remove start & end division from layer
division may change
NOTE this may create a VERY large GCD and resulting scene length
** TODO have 'effective envelope for layer' to speed up reading
** TODO division & clk behaviour
3 ways to set division
- via entry into panel in middle
- via clk
- via length of first recording

in all cases, a division length is defined
& recordings are snapped to intervals of the length.

can the division length be changed after scene is created?
is it a property of a scene?
