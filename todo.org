- *SDT*: scene dub time.
  'safe/practice' mode.  at layer end, discard and create new.
  ->SDC write to circle at layer end. 
  ->SET write to time at layer end if disengaged, else, extend.
- *SDC*: scene dub circle.
  'dub mode'. layer length preset to active layer length (or last?). at end, new dub layer.
  ->SDT cancel write.
  ->SEC extend at end.
- *SET*: scene extend time.
    'time write' mode. record at time position. non looping.
    ->SEC end layer and create new loop layer
    ->SDT discard and create new dub time layer of same length.
- *SEC*: scene extend circle.
   new looping layer with new length
   ->SDC end layer and create new loop layer with preset length.

  'layer' mode changes to alternate layer-scope behaviour.
  used for editting active layer.  
  changes target layer to only be active layer (and merged layers).
  'merges' new layers under this layer number.
  SEL becomes this layers target layers.
