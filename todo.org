* Finish CIRCLE with love self functionality
** New Framework
*** PHASE dependency across groups
- if you slow down the outer period, all periods inside slow, though they may spin at different rates

** NEXT/PREV buttons with group creation

* Create gko expander for timeline
/** Records Love movement on timeline

    v~~LOVE-G1~~___~~
    ---------------------------------
          ^--LOVE~G2~~~_~

    IDEA: potentialities[timelines]

  This means timeline is handled by external unit
  Members are relative to groups
  Do not need timelinepositions
  AFTERALL, what if you want to go to 2->3->2? it skips back in timeline now! but this is not what we need.

struct Gko {

* When you START loving a group/member which is zero'd, PLAY from start
* TODO Love Self/Other Param
** TODO Rename NewLove to Love
** Add Love Other mode
prev / next changes focus group
love acts as A/B -- focus group is focus
