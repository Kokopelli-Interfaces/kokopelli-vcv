* TODO Version
A version is simply a collection of looping buffers, or, in gko's terminology, a
collection of 'layers'.

The ~VERSION~ parameter adjusts which version ~GKO~ records and reads from.

If ~VERSION~'s position is between two versions, the behaviour will depend on the
"version transition" option.
- If set to  'smooth' it will output a weighted mix of both versions, allowing for smooth crossfading between versions.
- If set to 'discrete', the version will snap to the nearest version.
- If  set to 'sequence', the version will snap to the nearest version at the next
  clk step, and will also reset the play position of the version on transitioning.

The port directly under ~VERSION~ modulates the parameter, allowing for
interesting crossfade patterns, or voltage controlled version sequencing.

One may use multiple ~VERSIONs~ to sequence musical sections or, in the case ~GKO~
is capturing control voltage, a keygkor for control voltage.

Versions that have not recorded anything start with the layers of the version
before, so one may progress to the next version to leave behind a 'checkpoint',
that one may return to, or to just start developing a new version by altering the
current one.

* GKO Additional Uses Cases
** Delay Unit
~GKO~ can function as a delay unit in the case /add/ mode is consistently on
in /layer/ mode. ~DELTA~ would control the feedback in this case.

One may use ~GKO-X~ to change the rate and offset of the delays to produce
cool delay effects.

** Pitch Shifter
When one sets up ~GKO~ as a delay unit with a small layer size and adjusts
the ~RATE~ of ~GKO-X~, it will seem like the pitch of the sound is higher or
lower.

** Advanced Sample & Hold / Sequencer
When one sets ~RATE~ to 0, ~GKO~ does not progress at all but still may record
and read signals. In this case, it acts as an advanced sample and hold module.
Adjusting the ~VERSION~ knob smoothly transitions between samples.

One may sequence samples in interesting ways using the ~VERSION~ modulation port.
** Advanced 'MIDI' Looper
When ~GKO~ is expanding ~PLAY~, one may create interesting playback patterns
by recording some GATE, VOCT, and VEL signals, and varying or modulating the
~RATE~ and ~POS~ ports. One idea is to record a chord, and modulate ~RATE~ and
~POS~ with low frequency noise sources with channel variation to create
fluctuating, dreamy note sequences.
** An Instrument
One may patch the ~RATE~ port with a VOCT signal, and the ~PLAY~ port with a
GATE signal, patch the output VCA with a GATE controlled envelope, and play
~GKO~ as if it were an instrument.

This use case applies to all the additional use cases below.

** Wonky Audio Playback Unit
One may patch the ~RATE~ port to modulate the speed of playback and recording,
and one may patch the ~POS~ port to modulate the offset of ~GKO~ layers.
Using these, one could get some cool sounds with ~GKO~ - especially if there
is variation across channels. Have you ever wondered what playing back speech
with a sin wave sounds like? I have.

** Wavetable Oscillator with Additive and Subtractive Synthesis Capabilities
~GKO~ can be a wavetable oscillator if either the ~PHASE~ rate is high, 

In this use case, the ~VERSION~ parameter morphs between recorded waves, and the
~DELTA~ parameter would add or subract from a ~VERSIONs~ wave.

I LOVE IT

in LOVE mode, it emerges with unit so twisting knob past threshold will create a new emerges with
voice and layer together, making a new level in the graph of emergence

                 WOW
                 isn't that true
                 love to all is the middle point
                 the balance
                 you do not want to love more

                 it becomes a lord of the rings power ring type of deal
                 so it is a balance!

_LOVE EVERYTHING_
that is the goal
we only have love
we are only loving too much
we are attached
we do not want to lose
we say 'no' to other potentiality

for the devouring mother
it is that she loves a part of the child that isn't his full being
and loves it too hard
so that other potentiality does not realize

just as one chooses which seeds to use in their garden
and then which flowers to grow

one chooses what to love

and if one loves only one seed, the others will not exist

moral of the story:
we must love emergence
not particulars
one ring to rule them all... no
only gko holds the one true ring

* TODO speeds for all the voices, bpm is associated with each voice! not everything
- save phase rate bpm for voice and save it... this is what gets outputted on the output port
  - have button at bottom which affects whether the voices phase is set to the INPUT phase...
  - output voice phase always
  - next voices ~is~ the input phase ~else~ the saved voice being focused
  - if input phase and =SET= mode, output phase is still the saved voice phase (allows for slowing
    down voice, because new input phase is saved if button transition)
* Architecture
_Emernet_
What creates the network in the Emernet?
At each node, an energy diversion occurs.
A cell is not one cell, but two cells.
The energy has diverged.
Now there is a multi-cellular organism.
Just as there are both violins and piano.

An edge in the network is created through relationship.
A cluster of voices emerge when the new voice Loves the other voices in the cluster.
Or when it hates them and influences them to not exist.

2. Turn =LOVE= knob up halfway on =SIG= module in order to give energy to the =SIG= input signal and 
   captured signals.
3. Press the =CAPTURE= button to capture window of emernet and thus loop the =SIG= input signal.
