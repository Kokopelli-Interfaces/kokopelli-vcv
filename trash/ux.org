* features
** -grouping mechanism
forget which layers are which
hard to know larger song scope
my brain: new emergence level with larger breadth - song sections ie chorus, verse...  (just a collection of layers)
(TODO get outer circle 'emerge' button working to create groups)
some way to arrange sections intro->v1->chor->v1+
VISUAL
nodes on a graph?
loop circles inside circles?


- do not create timelline without pedal
avoids unconscious creation
* tweaks
* bugs
** TODO undo does not undo new loop length
** TODO loops are offbeat when finished
